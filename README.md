# Hi there, I'm Marko 👋

🎓 I have a B.S. in Computer Science, with a strong interest in software development, cybersecurity, and systems programming.  
💻 I enjoy designing and building applications, tools, and systems that solve real world problems from full stack web APIs to mobile apps and automation scripts.

🧠 I’ve worked with:

- Java, Python, and C for backend development and system-level tasks  
- Dart & Flutter for mobile app development  
- Scala for functional programming and academic projects  

🛠️ I'm skilled at:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Building RESTful APIs and CLI tools
- Creating Flutter mobile UIs
- Debugging, testing, and improving performance
- Working in Linux-based development environments

🌱 I'm currently expanding my knowledge in:
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
- Machine learning integration
- Open-source contributions
